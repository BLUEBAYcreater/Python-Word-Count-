# Python-Word-Count-
Small line of code that makes an major impact on Websites, Apps, Blogs and many number of application that stores data in form of text

Many number of application around the world takes huge amount of text data through web, review, comments and many more.
It's impossible for humans to ananylze those kinds of huge data.

I programmed a sweet and short code, that analyzes the maximum text though word count and stop words.


# What this small code project does?
1. It takes data(text) in huge amount and anaylzes maximum words.
2. Therefore, we can find the keywords user are using most.
3. Through the keywords we can improve our website optimization.

# How to run?

1. Install wordcloud in ananconda jupyter notebook.
2. Create text file, containing raw data.
3. Use wordcount plugin to read the data from the file.
4. Use MPLIB for displaying data in color.
5. Choose the suitable background and assign number of text to be displayed.
6. After displaying, on the basis of color. Identify the number of keywords.
7. If keywords lie 'and, 'most, 'the' are more, remove them. By asssigning the value for the stopwords. So they wont be repeated.
